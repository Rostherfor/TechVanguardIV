        <div> <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
            if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2></div>
            <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                 I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

        <div>  <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </h2>  </div>
            <p class="parafo1">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                 I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                  I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things 
                  about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on 
                  and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                   It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                   In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
                It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

            <div>  <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance 
            from them and learning from their experiences was easy</h2> </div>
        <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
             The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as
              a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you
             need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
